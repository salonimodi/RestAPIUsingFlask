Flask Project with JWT Authentication and MySQL Database
This Flask project demonstrates how to use JWT authentication and a MySQL database to build a secure and scalable web application.

**Features**:
* **JWT authentication**: Users can log in and receive a JWT token, which can then be used to access protected endpoints.
* **MySQL database**: The project uses a MySQL database to store user data and other application data.
* **Admin-protected endpoints**: Some endpoints are only accessible to administrators.

**Usage**:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Create a MySQL database and user.
* Update the database.py file with your database connection information.
* Run the Flask server: flask run
* Access the API endpoints in your browser or with a client such as Postman.
