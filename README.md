Flask Project with JWT Authentication and MySQL Database
This Flask project demonstrates how to use JWT authentication and a MySQL database to build a secure and scalable web application.

**Features**:
**JWT authentication**: Users can log in and receive a JWT token, which can then be used to access protected endpoints.
**MySQL database**: The project uses a MySQL database to store user data and other application data.
**Admin-protected endpoints**: Some endpoints are only accessible to administrators.

**Requirements**:
Python 3.6 or higher
Flask 2.2.2
Flask-JWT-Extended 4.3.3
Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.0.2
Flask-MySQL 2.0.0
mysqlclient 2.1.0

**Usage**:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a MySQL database and user.
Update the database.py file with your database connection information.
